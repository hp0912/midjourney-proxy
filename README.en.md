## CloudFlare Verifier

Only supports Windows deployment (TLS 1.3 supported, Windows 11 or Windows Server 2022 required). Since the CloudFlare verifier uses Chrome, it must be deployed on a Windows environment; Linux deployment is not supported due to dependencies on many libraries.

Note: You must provide a 2captcha.com API key for self-deployment, or it won't function. Pricing: 1000 verifications/9 CNY. Official website: <https://2captcha.cn/p/cloudflare-turnstile>

Tip: The first startup will download the Chrome browser, which may take some time. Please be patient.

> Example `appsettings.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "Demo": null, // Set website to demo mode
  "Captcha": {
    "Concurrent": 1, // Number of concurrent processes
    "Headless": true, // Whether to run Chrome in headless mode
    "TwoCaptchaKey": "" // API key for 2captcha.com
  },
  "urls": "http://*:8081" // Default port
}
```

## Bot Token (Optional Configuration)

This project uses the Discord Bot Token to connect to wss, providing error messages and full functionality to ensure high availability of messages.

[Bot Token Configuration Guide](./docs/en/api.md)

## Drawing Frequency Warning

- Task interval: 30‚Äì180 seconds, with a minimum of 3.6 seconds before execution.
- Daily limit: 200 drawings.
- Recommended daily working hours: 09:10‚Äì22:50.
